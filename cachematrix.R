## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

## function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix"
## which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4. get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## function cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## created with the makeCacheMatrix function. 
## If the inverse was already calculated, it gets the inverse from cache
## If the inverse was not calculated, it sets the inverse in cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
}
